# Friendly Feed

**[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/friendly-feed/dohehejmmbcfejempphbkcehfhinodem)**

No more trending, related, suggested, or sponsored content; no more activity streams; no more ads; just updates from friends and pages.

Make your Facebook feed friendly. This extension simply hides several annoying elements from Facebook, including trending topics, "related" and "suggested" content or groups, "people you may know," ads, etc. Because this is intended to make your feed only show posts written by your friends and pages you like, this extension will also hide all feed items that include "this" in the title, which will effectively hide a majority of your friends' activity. These posts are typically titled/prefixed with "John Doe liked this" or "Jane Doe commented on this." The idea is to create a Facebook feed of only your friends' posts.
